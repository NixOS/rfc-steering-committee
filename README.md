# Workflow for RFC Steering committee

## Before meeting
- Prepare a collaborative notepad with the meeting agenda (`rfc-report.py` generates a template, make sure to set `GITHUB_TOKEN` for running it)

## Agenda
- Meet in [Jitsi Meet nixos-rfc-steering-committee](https://meet.jit.si/nixos-rfc-steering-committee)
- Overview of RFC statuses
- Is anyone going to be absent next meeting?

## After meeting
- Meeting leader puts agenda/notes in a [new issue](https://github.com/NixOS/rfc-steering-committee/issues/new)
